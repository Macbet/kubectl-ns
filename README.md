# kubectl-ns

This repository implements a single kubectl plugin for switching the namespace
that the current KUBECONFIG context points to. In order to remain as indestructive
as possible, no previously existing contexts are modified.

**Note:** go-get or vendor this package as `k8s.io/kubectl-ns`.

This repository makes use of the genericclioptions in [k8s.io/cli-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes/cli-runtime)
to generate a set of configuration flags which are in turn used to generate a raw representation of
the user's KUBECONFIG, as well as to obtain configuration which can be used with RESTClients when sending
requests to a kubernetes api server.

## Details

The sample cli plugin uses the [client-go library](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/tools/clientcmd) to patch an existing KUBECONFIG file in a user's environment in order to update context information to point the client to a new or existing namespace.

In order to be as non-destructive as possible, no existing contexts are modified in any way. Rather, the current context is examined, and matched against existing contexts to find a context containing the same "AuthInfo" and "Cluster" information, but with the newly desired namespace requested by the user.

## Purpose

This is a fully-working example of how to build a kubectl plugin using the same set of tools and helpers available to kubectl.

## Building + Running

```sh
# assumes you have a working KUBECONFIG
$ go build cmd/kubectl-ns.go
# place the built binary somewhere in your PATH
$ cp ./kubectl-ns /usr/local/bin

# you can now begin using this plugin as a regular kubectl command:
# update your configuration to point to "new-namespace"
$ kubectl ns new-namespace
# any kubectl commands you perform from now on will use "new-namespace"
$ kubectl get pod
NAME                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
new-namespace-pod   1/1       Running   0          1h

# list all of the namespace in use by contexts in your KUBECONFIG
$ kubectl ns --list

# show the namespace that the currently set context in your KUBECONFIG points to
$ kubectl ns
```

## Installing via Krew

[Krew](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew) is a kubectl plugin package manager for `kubectl` plugins.
This plugin is listed under the name `change-ns` in `Krew`'s plugin index.

You can skip manual compilation and instead _install this plugin via Krew by using the following steps_ (assumes you have Krew already installed):

```sh
kubectl krew update && kubectl krew install change-ns
```

Assuming you've installed this plugin using `Krew`, **you will need to invoke it as "change-ns", instead of simply "ns"**:

```sh
# show the namespace that the currently set context in your KUBECONFIG points to
kubectl change-ns
```

## Use Cases

This plugin can be used as a developer tool, in order to quickly view or change the current namespace
that kubectl points to.

It can also be used as a means of showcasing usage of the cli-runtime set of utilities to aid in
third-party plugin development.

This plugin's functionality is similar to that of the [oc project](https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cli.md#oc-project) command.
This plugin has been tested against OpenShift and Kubernetes clusters using `kubectl`.

## Cleanup

You can "uninstall" this plugin from kubectl by simply removing it from your PATH:

    $ rm /usr/local/bin/kubectl-ns

## Where does it come from?

This plugin is a fork of the [sample-cli-plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-cli-plugin).
It is maintained and updated here, as a separate effort, in order to make it available through plugin managers, such
as [Krew](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/krew).
